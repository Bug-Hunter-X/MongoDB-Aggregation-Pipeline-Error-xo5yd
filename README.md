# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines resulting in unexpected or inaccurate results.

The bug involves an incorrectly structured aggregation pipeline, leading to incorrect data processing. The solution provides a corrected pipeline to obtain the expected outcome.

## Bug Description
The original aggregation pipeline has a logical error in the stage ordering or the inclusion of specific stages. This error causes the pipeline to produce results that deviate from the intended output. The issue is resolved by carefully examining and correcting the sequence and functionality of each stage within the pipeline.  The updated pipeline provides the correct output. 

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install MongoDB and connect to a local instance.
3. Execute the JavaScript code in `bug.js`.
4. Observe the incorrect output.
5. Execute the corrected JavaScript code in `bugSolution.js`.
6. Verify the correct output.

## Solution
The corrected aggregation pipeline in `bugSolution.js` addresses the issues in the original pipeline, resulting in the expected output. The solution highlights the importance of meticulous pipeline construction to ensure accurate aggregation results.
